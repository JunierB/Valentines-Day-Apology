# 💕 Valentine's Day Project for Olivia

This is a special interactive website designed to ask Olivia to be your Valentine!

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the folder `d:\Valentines day\` on your computer.
2. Double-click `index.html` to open it in your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, etc.).
3. The site will load with animations and sound effects (if added later).

## Customization
- **Questions**: Edit `script.js` to change questions or answers.
  - Look for the `questions` array at the top of the file.
  - `correct: 0` means the first option is correct, `1` is the second, etc.
- **Messages**: You can change the "Yes" message in `index.html` inside the `<p class="celebration-msg">` tag.

## Deployment
If you want to send this to Olivia's phone, you can host it for free using **GitHub Pages** or **Netlify**. Let me know if you need help with that!
